## 🧰 sql-employee-time-db Repository (Large-Scale Project)
  [This portfolio project](https://github.com/nerwuuus/sql-employee-time-db/tree/main) showcases a comprehensive database solution designed for analytics, from structured data modelling to generating actionable insights. This project is the result of a full reconstruction of the [ess-time-registration](https://github.com/nerwuuus/portfolio-projects/tree/ess-time-registration) project. A Python script is used to truncate bronze layer tables and load data into them.
  <br>**Due to the presence of personal data, raw datasets are not available for external use.**

**Stack:**
* Microsoft Excel
* VSCode
* Python
* pgAdmin4
* PostgreSQL
* PowerShell
* SharePoint
* PowerQuery
* Copilot
